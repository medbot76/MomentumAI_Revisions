I notice there's a mismatch - you've asked "Why is this happening?" with attached screenshots, which appears to be a troubleshooting question rather than a request for design guidelines.

The images you've attached (IMG_6867 and IMG_6868) aren't visible to me in a way that lets me analyze the specific issue you're experiencing.

**Could you clarify what you need?**

1. **If you're experiencing a technical issue**: Please describe what's happening in the screenshots - what behavior are you seeing vs. what you expected?

2. **If you want design guidelines for a new project**: Please describe what you're building (e.g., "a landing page for a SaaS product," "an e-commerce site for handmade goods," "a portfolio for a photographer").

3. **If you want me to review/improve existing design**: Let me know what aspect needs attention.

I'm ready to help once I understand whether you need:
- Technical debugging assistance
- New design guidelines for a project
- Design review/improvements

What would be most helpful for you right now?
